##Using the shell scripts
You will have to set the PATH variable for all scripts to work anywhere. First, go to the folder containing all the script files. 
Then type

`mkdir ~/bin`

to create a folder called *bin* in root folder (or user folder, doesn't matter). Then type

`cp * ~/bin`

to copy all files from *current folder* to *bin*. Now to set PATH, first open the .bashrc file using

`nano ~/.bashrc`

This will open a file containing a lot of codes. Just scroll down to the end of the file and add the following line:

`export PATH=~/bin:"${PATH}"`

and then save changes using ctrl+O.

Now you can use the scripts everywhere in any path, just like a linux command. Just type the script name with the required arguments.
For example, help for 'run' command can be obtained by typing
`run --help` or
`run -h`
